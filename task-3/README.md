This is Task 03 of the Eudyptula Challenge
------------------------------------------
Now that you have your custom kernel up and running, it's time to modify
it!

The tasks for this round is:
  - take the kernel git tree from Task 02 and modify the Makefile to
    and modify the EXTRAVERSION field.  Do this in a way that the
    running kernel (after modifying the Makefile, rebuilding, and
    rebooting) has the characters "-eudyptula" in the version string.
  - show proof of booting this kernel.  Extra cookies for you by
    providing creative examples, especially if done in intrepretive
    dance at your local pub.
  - Send a patch that shows the Makefile modified.  Do this in a manner
    that would be acceptable for merging in the kernel source tree.
    (Hint, read the file Documentation/SubmittingPatches and follow the
    steps there.)
